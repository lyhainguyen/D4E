    <title>What is Boolean? Write down 3 different expression that results a Boolean type (i.e. 5 ==
        6)</title>

    Q1.
    In Python, the two Boolean values are True and False (the capitalization must be exactly as
    shown), and the Python type is bool.
    >>> type(True)
    <class ’bool’>
        >>> type(true)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<interactive input>", line 1, in <module>
        NameError: name ’true’ is not defined

    A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to produce a result which is a Boolean
    value. For example, the operator == tests if two values are equal. It produces (or yields) a
    Boolean value:
    >>> 5 == (3 + 2) # Is five equal 5 to the result of 3 + 2?
    True
    >>> 5 == 6
    False
    >>> j = "hel"
    >>> j + "lo" == "hello"
    True

    Q3.
    One conditional can also be nested within another.
    Example:
    if x < y:
    STATEMENTS_A
    else:
    if x > y:
    STATEMENTS_B
    else:
    STATEMENTS_C

    if 0 < x: # Assume x is an int here
    if x < 10:
    print("x is a positive single digit.")
